# Tasks Package

Special formatting for .todo files. Allows you to easily add, complete,
and archive your tasks.

This is based primarily off of https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks

Any line that ends with : will be considered a header (like My Things:)

## Hotkeys

* cmd-enter: add a new todo item below the current
* cmd-d: toggle completion of the task
* cmd-a: move all completed tasks to the archive section
