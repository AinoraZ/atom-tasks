# Tasks Package

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irrationalistic/atom-tasks/master/images/tasks_example.png)

Special formatting for .todo files. Allows you to easily add, complete,
and archive your tasks.

This is based primarily off of https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks

Any line that ends with : will be considered a header (like My Things:)

This uses utf characters, so it is still valid as a plain text document.

## Hotkeys

* **cmd-enter:** add a new todo item below the current
* **cmd-d:** toggle completion of the task
* **cmd-a:** move all completed tasks to the archive section
